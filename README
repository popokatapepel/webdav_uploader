Programm to upload big directories to owncloud or any other webdav rescource. Since there is a limit in file size for uploading, this sripts pack the content splits the archive, loads the parts to webdav, cats and unpacks the data.

Setup install all the software described in depends.sh at first.

To run the uploader use uploader as su. The first parameter needs to be the dir you want to upload.
E.g:
 	sudo ./uploader.sh /home

In the webdav a new folder uploader will be created. Each job receives an ID in which you will find your data
